### The World English Bible

The World English Bible is in the Public Domain. That means that it is not copyrighted. However, "World English Bible"
is a Trademark of eBible.org.

You may copy, publish, proclaim, distribute, redistribute, sell, give away, quote, memorize, read publicly, broadcast,
transmit, share, back up, post on the Internet, print, reproduce, preach, teach from, and use the World English Bible as
much as you want, and others may also do so. All we ask is that if you CHANGE the actual text of the World English Bible
in any way, you not call the result the World English Bible any more. This is to avoid confusion, not to limit your
freedom. The Holy Bible is God's Word. It belongs to God. He gave it to us freely, and we who have worked on this
translation freely give it to you by dedicating it to the Public Domain.

Donations to help with the expenses of this project and thus help others have free access to the Word of God may be made
to us, but are not required. Please see http://MLJohnson.org/partner/ for more about that.

The World English Bible is a work in progress. All Old Testament and New Testament books are essentially done, but
well-justified typo reports and translation suggestions will still be considered. New updates will be posted on
http://eBible.org/web/ and at http://WorldEnglishBible.org.
